The Ancestors discovered the Abyss — another world full of energy, where time and space have no meaning. Our entire arsenal of known magic comes from the Abyss. We can summon this power to our world — and that’s the reason we are called Summoners."

Unrestrained by imagination, this entity is the most powerful being we know to this day. Theoretically, Nomolas is capable of destroying even a God.
The ancestors managed to communicate with Nomolas, who turned out to be obedient like all summoned magical entities."

To measure his potential the Ancestors wished for the most beautiful city in the world, to be located in the middle of the desert, that would become their new home, the capital of their land. In a few moments, Nomolas created al-Kamija from thin air.

Since then, a few centuries have passed. Nomolas sleeps in the central palace, waiting for another call. We try to use him only if there is no other choice. Other magical entities summoned after Nomolas weren’t as powerful as he, although their power is still impressive and is completely sufficient for our needs."

Maybe because no one in that place can summon us... However, in the last few years, we managed to design a special magic circle that is able to take us to that unreal world. Our tests were successful, but to this day we cannot summon previously sent items back to our world. As a result of this, although it sounds crazy, we decided to send our entire land to the Abyss, hoping that we will find the solution on the other side. But even if we find it, we may not use it...

It should be stressed that we believe we will find in the Abyss the ultimate sense of our life and decide to stay there forever."

Meanwhile, Mehir was announced as the greatest hero of Kharos. While his scouts were searching for possible threats from the rest of the destroyed army, he spent a lot of time with Anthi, getting to know the Kharosan culture and the history of the Ancestral Lands."

This specific dualism reflects in their social structure. The Kharosan society is ruled by wise priestesses of the cult of light which are adept in magic and use it without drawing circles. The army and all connected services are subordinated to the so-called sun warriors."

Often called white magic, it comes from the energy of the Sun, a fact that greatly surprised the Summoners. To them, magic always has come from the Abyss. The Priestesses can control the power of the light using their minds. Mehir noted that the Darkblooded, the dark hordes, and the mysterious flying mage, Aerius, were also using this weird technique of spellcasting."

The Great Circle was becoming outdated, drifting away from its otherworldly location in the Abyss. However, experiments carried out by the Summoners in former days had shown that fluctuations of time in multi-world space entailed a delay of twenty-five days between events and their visible consequences. The messenger had travelled for twelve days, which meant the Summoners had thirteen days to finish the Circle in its current form and move to the Abyss. If it were not completed in time, the whole work would be wasted."

In the Central Palace of al-Kamija a great celebration began, during which the Circle was going to be connected with the opened portal. The leaders of the Trinity and the chairmen of the Highest Council painted together the last segment and when it touched the other world..."

Even flying carpets couldn’t fly so high, so Mehir’s people decided to draw a special circle on the ship’s floor, similar to the one which was used by the Ka-Gattan Summoners centuries ago to travel between the surface and the underground. After a few hours everything was ready and the first who had decided to teleport to the ‘flying island’ was Mehir."

Traveling there using a normal boat would take months, where at the same time the flying ship could reach the destination in hours. Its deck was small and could not hold all summoners, so the Magi equipped Mehir with a special magical circle, which was able to teleport his troops from the Sky Kingdom to his location. When Mehir and Rashti boarded the ship, the Guru gave them three Ums—magical creatures serving the Magi—as a gift. He also gave Mehir a special magical spell allowing him to return instantly with his men and the battery.
			
After that the flying ship took off and headed north..."
