It is an unusual place. It is not damaged by destructive influences of time and sand. The Sun doesn’t burn its walls, because they’re always cool. There are no shortages of goods, because everything is found here.

How is this possible?"

The Ancestors discovered the Abyss — another world full of energy, where time and space have no meaning. Our entire arsenal of known magic comes from the Abyss. We can summon this power to our world — and that’s the reason we are called Summoners."

Unrestrained by imagination, this entity is the most powerful being we know to this day. Theoretically, Nomolas is capable of destroying even a God.
The ancestors managed to communicate with Nomolas, who turned out to be obedient like all summoned magical entities."

To measure his potential the Ancestors wished for the most beautiful city in the world, to be located in the middle of the desert, that would become their new home, the capital of their land. In a few moments, Nomolas created al-Kamija from thin air.

Since then, a few centuries have passed. Nomolas rests in the central palace, waiting for another call. We try to use him only if there is no other choice. Other magical entities summoned after Nomolas weren’t as powerful as he, although their power is still impressive and is completely sufficient for our needs."

However, in the last few years, we managed to design a special magic circle that is able to take us to that unreal world. Our tests were successful, but to this day we cannot summon previously sent items back to our world. As a result of this, although it sounds crazy, we decided to send our entire land to the Abyss, hoping that we will find the solution on the other side. But even if we find it, we may not use it...

It should be stressed that we believe we will find in the Abyss the ultimate sense of our life and decide to stay there forever."

After a few hours of flight they landed in a very distant place, just in front of a small lizard wearing an ornamental feather headdress. He was the leader of all forest creatures, called ‘The Keeper’. After listening to Rhaxiz’s report, this lord of the forest spoke with the captured Summoners, as to why they had been brought before him."

        [part]
            story=_ "From time immemorial The Keeper’s people—the ‘Darkblooded’—had protected their lands from barbarian hordes that arose in local wastelands. This Jungle of Life that the Summoners have entered was their home, as much the Great Desert is to the Summoners. A holy place for its dwellers, this unusual tropical land is protected at all costs. The Darkblooded had mistaken the Summoners for barbarians because of their similar language. Despite that, Rhaxiz hadn’t attacked because Mehir had explained he was not from the east, where enemy lives, but from the north. Nevertheless the appearance of a ‘fiery demon’ had scared the lizards so much that they had thrown themselves upon the Summoners, thinking these northerners wanted to burn their holy forest. Although Rhaxiz had withdrawn to defend the Jungle in other places, the Summoners had still been observed."

In the construction of the ‘devil’s path’ a part of their forest had been destroyed, and they couldn’t forgive it. Each tree was holy to them, and these newcomers from the north had cut down many. Jaffar and Mehir explained as best as they could who they were, and why the construction of the Circle was so important for all of the Summoners. The Darkblooded couldn’t understand some words, but it didn’t matter. The Keeper decided to set them free, but in the same breath he threatened them with immediate death if they would so much as cut the grass."

Barbarians held them at Fire Canyon, so named for the hot sun that dried it long ago. He noted the Summoners’ prowess at desert fighting. Upon contemplation, The Keeper ordered the Summoners to be brought back. He ordered Mehir — the more trustworthy — to mount a rescue. If all captives were returned in one piece, the Summoners would be given permission to continue their work in the Darkblooded’s territory. Such was their value: more than trees, more than gold. Against their lives, Jaffar and his massive chest of gold were held hostage, for The Keeper knew the latter’s small mind."

During his visit Mehir learned many things about the Kharosans and their religion. The Kharosans worship the Sun as God and the light as the source of life. This specific dualism reflects in their social structure. The Kharosan society is ruled by wise priestesses of the cult of light which are adept in magic and use it without drawing circles.

The Great Circle is now becoming outdated, drifting away from its otherworldly location in the Abyss. However, the experiments carried out by Mehir’s ancestors showed that fluctuations of time in multi-world space would delay the reactions of actions that took place for twenty-nine days. The messenger traveled for fourteen days, which meant that the Summoners had fifteen days to finish the Circle in its current form and move to the Abyss.
